# ML-CRISPR-Integration
📌 Overview

This repository contains the complete, end-to-end reproducible pipeline developed for the manuscript:

“Integrated Machine Learning and CRISPR Scoring Framework for Prioritizing Therapeutic gRNAs Targeting TCF7L2 in Type 2 Diabetes.”

The project integrates three major computational layers:

GWAS SNP prioritization (DIAMANTE T2D; Chr10)

Machine learning model for Type 2 Diabetes prediction (UCI Pima Indians dataset)

CRISPR gRNA efficiency prediction + off-target scoring using the full DeepSpCas9 (12,832 guides) dataset

All code, datasets (where allowed), preprocessing scripts, trained models, and results are included to ensure full reproducibility.
